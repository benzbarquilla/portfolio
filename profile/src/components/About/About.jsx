            Hi, I'm a 4th year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
            student with foundational knowledge in IT systems, networking, and
            software development gained through academic and project-based
            experience. I am seeking an internship to apply my skills as an IT
            intern and to gain real-world experience.
